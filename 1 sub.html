            <td>In order to improve a company's brand, increase sales, and drive visitors to their website, social media marketingâ€”also known as digital marketing or e-marketing makes use of social media platforms where people interact and exchange information. With the help of sophisticated data analytics, it allows businesses to interact with both current and potential clients, tracking the success of their campaigns and looking for new avenues for interaction. Social media engagements are interactive. This means that businesses can profit from organic advertising through user-generated electronic word-of-mouth recommendations, whether through direct contact or passive involvement like liking. In addition to influencing customer choices, this positive transmission effect makes it possible to track social justice and other quantifiable results that show the return on investment of social media marketing initiatives.</td>
