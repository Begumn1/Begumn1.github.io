            <td>The psychological effects of cyberbullying are severe, including increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression as well as a marked reduction in self-esteem as a result of the abusive actions committed against the victims. Social networking platforms provide victims with anonymity, which intensifies their distress and prolongs their emotions of helplessness and loneliness. As a result, victims face significant obstacles when attempting to obtain support or identify their harassers, which increases their susceptibility and psychological distress. Combating cyberbullying requires a multimodal strategy that includes awareness raising, educational initiatives, and the application of practical preventive measures. A safer online environment is greatly aided by educational initiatives that cultivate digital citizenship, encourage responsible online behavior, and increase public awareness of the negative effects of cyberbullying.</td>

            <td>The prevalence of cyberbullying on social media platforms highlights the critical need for quick action to stop this persistent problem. Research has repeatedly shown that a sizable percentage of teenagers and young adults have experienced cyberbullying or online harassment in one way or another. An disturbing example of the pervasiveness of cyberbullying in modern society is the Pew Research Center poll, which found that 46% of American teenagers had experienced cyberbullying. Social media platforms' broad reach and the anonymity they offer foster an environment that is favorable for cyberbullying to thrive, which exacerbates the negative consequences felt by those who are most vulnerable.</td>
